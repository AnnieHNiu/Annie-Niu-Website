        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-BusinessðŸ’¸</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Annie Niu is currently a Pre-Business major at the University of California, Riverside, pursuing a concentration in both business administration and management. Originally from San Jose, Annie is surprisingly enjoying her time studying in Southern California. In her free time, Annie enjoys spending time with friends. She can often be found trying to learn new songs or chords on either her guitar, her trumpet, or the piano. Though she currently resides in Riverside for her studies, Annie is originally from San Jose, California. Music is a big part of her life, and she is rarely seen without earbuds plugged in.<br><br>

        Though she played sports in middle school and outside of school, Annie focused most of her energy on playing in the marching band in high school. Doing four years of marching band taught her quite a lot. She credits marching band with teaching her about commitment, leadership, teamwork, and much more. She was a trumpet soloist in junior year, which taught her quite a bit about the burden of responsibility. This was because solos in marching band shows usually help the band obtain extra points, and the solo happened in the middle of the show where almost nobody else played. Being a section leader in her senior year taught her a lot about leading people and compromise. Finally, marching band taught her about time management, as practices and performances take up quite a bit of time. Many of the life skills that Annie has developed were in large thanks to participating in both her school marching band and a community marching band.<br><br>

        She is looking to extend her knowledge in the business world by gaining experience through different internships and jobs. Annieâ€™s past work experience consisted mainly of working at a variety of summer camps, where she was tasked with a multitude of jobs. In her most recent job, she worked closely with operations management and others in order to keep the camp running as smoothly as possible. This mainly consisted of setting up tables and different parts of the camp before patrons arrived, organizing after camp socials, coordinating staff schedules, relieving staff members for their respective breaks, preparing and delivering lunch for both the campers and the staff, running paperwork back and forth between management and the other staff, and more. She was able to gain some insight into the clockwork of running a summer camp as well as practice some leadership skills while working at Camp Galileo and Galileo Summer Quest. Annie has worked at this camp for two years. In addition, she has also worked at two other camps: Bald Eagle Sports Camps and Camp Imagineerz.
